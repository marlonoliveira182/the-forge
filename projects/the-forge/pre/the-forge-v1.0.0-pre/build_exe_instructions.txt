# How to Build the forge.exe

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder:
   cd projects/the-forge/dev/the-forge-v4.0.0-dev

2. Install dependencies (in your virtual environment, if you use one):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pyinstaller

3. Run PyInstaller to build the .exe:
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "microservices;microservices" --name "the forge" schema_to_excel_gui.py

   # If you want a custom icon, add:
   # --icon=assets/anvil.ico

4. The .exe will be in the dist/ folder as the forge.exe

5. You can now send this .exe to anyone. They do not need Python installed.

# Notes
- If you update the code or dependencies, rebuild the .exe.
- If you have issues with missing modules, let your assistant know the error message.
