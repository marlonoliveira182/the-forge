# XSD to Excel Conversion with Multiple Sheets Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enhances the XSD to Excel conversion functionality to support multiple sheets when an XSD contains multiple messages/elements. Each message in the XSD gets its own sheet in the generated Excel file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced XSDParser Service (`services/xsd_parser_service.py`)

**Added new method:**
- `parse_xsd_file_by_messages(xsd_path)`: Parses XSD file and groups results by message/element name
- `_sanitize_sheet_name(name)`: Sanitizes element names for use as Excel sheet names

**Key Features:**
- Groups parsed data by element name (message name)
- Sanitizes sheet names to comply with Excel restrictions (max 31 chars, no special chars)
- Returns a dictionary where keys are sheet names and values are lists of rows
- Maintains all existing parsing logic and structure

### 2. Updated App Files (`app.py` and `app_fixed.py`)

**Modified XSD to Excel conversion:**
- Changed from `parse_xsd_file()` to `parse_xsd_file_by_messages()`
- Updated Excel export to use the new multi-sheet data structure
- Each message now gets its own sheet in the Excel file

### 3. Test Implementation (`test_xsd_to_excel_multiple_sheets.py`)

**Comprehensive test suite:**
- Tests sheet name sanitization with various edge cases
- Tests XSD parsing with multiple messages
- Verifies Excel export with multiple sheets
- Generates test XSD with 3 different messages (CustomerRequest, OrderRequest, PaymentRequest)

## Technical Details

### Sheet Name Sanitization

The `_sanitize_sheet_name()` method handles Excel sheet name restrictions:
- Removes invalid characters: `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `[`, `]`
- Limits length to 31 characters
- Provides fallback name "Sheet" for empty names

### Data Structure

The new parsing method returns:
```python
{
    "CustomerRequest": [rows_for_customer_request],
    "OrderRequest": [rows_for_order_request],
    "PaymentRequest": [rows_for_payment_request]
}
```

### Excel Export

The ExcelExporter service already supports multiple sheets, so no changes were needed there. It creates a separate worksheet for each key in the data dictionary.

## Test Results

âœ… **All tests passed successfully:**
- Sheet name sanitization: 9/9 test cases passed
- XSD parsing: Found all 3 expected messages
- Excel export: Generated 8,403 bytes Excel file with 3 sheets
- Data structure: Each sheet contains the correct number of rows

**Test Output:**
```
ðŸ“Š Found 3 messages:
  - CustomerRequest: 14 rows
  - OrderRequest: 14 rows
  - PaymentRequest: 10 rows
```

## Usage

When users select "XSD to Excel" in the Converter tool:
1. The XSD file is parsed using `parse_xsd_file_by_messages()`
2. Each message/element in the XSD gets its own sheet
3. Sheet names are sanitized to comply with Excel restrictions
4. The Excel file is generated with multiple worksheets

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Multiple messages are clearly separated into different sheets
2. **Improved Readability**: Users can easily navigate between different message types
3. **Maintains Compatibility**: Single-message XSDs still work correctly
4. **Excel Compliance**: Sheet names are properly sanitized for Excel compatibility

## Files Modified

1. `services/xsd_parser_service.py` - Added new parsing method
2. `app.py` - Updated XSD to Excel conversion
3. `app_fixed.py` - Updated XSD to Excel conversion
4. `test_xsd_to_excel_multiple_sheets.py` - New test file

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding sheet name collision handling for duplicate element names
- Add option to customize sheet naming conventions
- Consider adding summary sheet with overview of all messages
